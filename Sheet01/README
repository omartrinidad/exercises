Implement your solution in the file sheet01.cpp in the src directory.
Again the basic structure of the program is already given. There is quite
a lot of code to help you implement the final solution. Try to read and
understand the source code gist. All necessary header files are already
included.

Basically you can fill in your own source code wherever you see "TODO"

If you have problems understanding the existing code you can also delete
the helping functions (just use them for inspiration) and implement them
from scratch. But make sure that you don't mess up the overall structure
of the program.

Every tasks begins with 
	cout << "Task ...:" << endl;
and ends with
	waitKey(0);
	destroyAllWindows();	

which forces the program to wait and and draw all images called by "imshow"
until the user hits a button and then proceeds with the next task.

Compile your program (from within the src directory):
	cmake -G "Unix Makefiles"
	make
	./bin/sheet01 ../images/bonn.png


Please provide any other information required to run your program here...
