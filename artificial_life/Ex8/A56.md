### A56. Overall idea of evolutionary algorithms

Our **objective** is to have a good chocolate bar. We have 50 possible
ingredients (let's say `A, B, C, D, ..., AA, AB, AC, ..., AX`) , but we can only
use 20 of them in each bar. That is, the size of our search space is `50
Combination 20`.

In the **initialization** phase we can create 50 different chocolate bars
(`individuals`), each one with a different combination of ingredients
(`genomes`).

| Pieces/Ingredients | In1 | In2 | ... |In20 |
|--------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Piece 01           | A   | B   | ... | AX  |
| Piece 02           | E   | H   | ... | C   |
| ...                | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| Piece 03           | A   | AD  | ... | AE  |

**Fitness evaluation**. Some guys will taste our 50 pieces of chocolate, they
will rate each piece, (let's say from 0 to 10). At the end each chocolate will
score the average of the ratings

| Pieces/Guys        | 1   | 2   | ... | n   | **fitness function** |
|--------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|----------------------|
| Piece 01           | 10  | 8   | ... | 6.9 |   8.4                |
| Piece 02           | 9   | 7   | ... | 3.3 |   6.1                |
| ...                | ... | ... | ... | ... |   8.7                |
| Piece 03           | 9.9 | 9   | ... | 7.6 |   4.2                |

**External selection**. We will discard the pieces of chocolate with lower
fitness (&lambda;), and we will stay with the rest of the pieces (&mu;
`survivors`).

**Parent selection**. From the &mu; pieces of chocolates we have, we choose two
of them (`parents`)

**Inheritance**. To produce new pieces of chocolate, we will use the
`recombination by union of sets`,  from the new set we choose the first 20
elements.

**Mutation**. We choose one ingredient (or more) and we replace it with another
ingredient from the set of the rest 30 ingredients.
